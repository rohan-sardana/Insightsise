# Insightsise: Job Market Analysis System


Problem Statement
We aim to solve the problem of job market analysis by developing a system that will leverage real-time data from multiple sources for streaming, modeling, and visualization that will be used by candidates to make decisions on the job application or switch.


Market Analysis - Big Data Problem!
Any company’s performance over recent years can be assessed to gauge decisions regarding future investments one could make in a company and the company’s employee retention and attrition rates.
We have large-scale data available for the companies:
Financial Data: By analyzing large volumes of financial data, such as stock price, revenue, expenses, and profits, organizations can get a sense of how well a company is performing financially. This can be used to identify trends and patterns in financial performance and to inform business decisions.
Social Media Data: A positive sentiment on social media can be correlated with the good performance of any company. Especially, in the influencer age, where few tweets by profiles with credentials could influence sales of any product, companies thrive on social media index and Net Promoter Rate to increase revenue.
Employee Reviews Data: Based on the data of employee reviews on portals like Glassdoor, Blind, etc. We could derive meaningful insights regarding the workplace environment, internal product successes and failures, and company-wide operational sentiments to assess if a company could be joined at the given moment.
